Credit Score Analysis Report

This document presents an analysis of the wallet credit scores computed from Aave V2 DeFi transaction data.



Score Distribution

The credit scores were computed using a custom formula combining financial behavior and on-chain activity.

Key Observations:

- **Highly Polarized Distribution**:
  - ~800 wallets score very low (0–100)
  - ~700+ wallets score very high (900–1000)
  - Middle bands (300–700) have fewer entries

Interpretation:
- Many wallets had either very **minimal usage** (low tx and high liquidation) or were **very active and consistent** (high repayment and tx_per_day).
- This suggests a **bimodal user base**: either highly trusted or risky/inactive wallets.

Score Bin Breakdown

| Score Range      | Wallet Count |
|------------------|--------------|
| 0–100            | 835          |
| 100–200          | 20           |
| 200–300          | 45           |
| 300–400          | 29           |
| 400–500          | 110          |
| 500–600          | 210          |
| 600–700          | 197          |
| 700–800          | 303          |
| 800–900          | 92           |
| 900–1000         | 794          |

| Model            | MSE     | R² Score |
|------------------|---------|----------|
| GradientBoosting | 193.06  | 0.9987   |
| RandomForest     | 198.42  | 0.9987   |
| DecisionTree     | 272.44  | 0.9982   |

- All models perform very well due to the deterministic nature of the scoring function.
- GradientBoosting chosen for best generalization and lowest error.

Next Steps

- Tune feature weights to reduce score imbalance.
- Explore unsupervised clustering to validate wallet groupings.
- Incorporate time-series behavior (e.g., decay on inactivity).
- Include other DeFi protocols for cross-protocol credit reputation.

 Conclusion

The current scoring system effectively separates wallets based on key behavioral indicators. However, there's room to improve the balance of score distribution and ensure real-world DeFi applicability.
